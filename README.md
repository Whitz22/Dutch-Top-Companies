Webscraping

This repository was created to collect and analyze data on the largest companies in the Netherlands. 
By web scraping information from reputable sources, I want to gather insights into the Dutch business landscape, including key players, industries, and financial metrics.

Web scraping scripts: Includes Python scripts for scraping data from relevant websites listing the largest companies in the Netherlands.
Data analysis: Jupyter notebooks containing data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to derive insights from the scraped data.
